## iOS banking application integration with Apple Pay.

Developed in 2016-2017

Here was no demo or source, because of NDA. But... if you have and AkBars bank mobile app for iOS, you can try add

It was very specific work, because original app was an Web Single Page Application, wrapped by Cordova container. 
In such apps, native OS functionality can me used inside container through special plugins (it works as a bridge 
between OS and site in WebView)
All good, but there is no plugins for Apple Pay card provisioning in whole Cordova ecosystem... 
So, I was write it by myself. Web side - on javascript, and native side - on Objective C. 

Tech stack: Cordova, Objective C, javascript, backbone.

## Extended filters for HostCMS

Development started at 2014

There are many online stores in internet, and many content management systems. Some years ago I was like to use 
HostCMS for making online stores and other sites, because in very powerful even in free version and includes a good 
shop engine.

This engine can filter goods on page by some properties, but filtering vas very simple. So I write an module to 
provide an extended filtering and sorting. Now you become to see what properties are actual, what prices range 
applies to selected conditions, how many items are meet the conditions, order goods by popularity, or by values of 
any good' property and many more. 

It is must have for good online shop, so this module is commercial and is for sale, so I can not show you a sources, 
but you may see a demo page - http://test.strigo.ru/shop/camcorder/ (filtering block at the right column) or read 
some documentation (in russian, sorry) - http://hostcmsblog.ru/blog/extendedfilters/#install
